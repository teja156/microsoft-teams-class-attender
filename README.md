## Configure

There are few things you need to configure before running this bot.

 - Open *bot.py*, and put your microsoft teams credentials in the **CREDS** dictionary. 
 - Example - `CREDS  = {'email' : 'myemail@email.com', 'passwd':'''mypassword'''}`
 - Open *discord_webhook.py* and put your discord webhook URL in the **webhook_url** variable. 
 - Example - `webhook_url = "https://discordapp.com/...."`
